# BlazorChat
Sample one box chat in Blazor with no javascript

It's not perfect - hacked together in a couple of hours - sometimes messages don't refresh - sometimes the message box doesn't clear.
It's just a test, mainly to show a method of sharing data and having binding to an input with no javascript and no button.
